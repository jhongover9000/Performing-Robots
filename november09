### Towards a Dramaturgy of Robots and Object-Figures: A Response

Something that I found rather interesting and thought-provoking was the conceptual difference in how theatre/acting and manufacturing industries operate. It was something that we had talked about multiple times throughout our discussions, but I was never fully able to pinpoint what I was thinking until this reading, where it sort of clicked. Since manufacturing industries operate on economies of scale, it is definitely more beneficial and profitable to replace humans with machines.

But in theatre, that isn't really the case. Most often companies that perform large-scale shows on venues such as Broadway are already operating at a loss, kept up largely due to sponsors. In situations where robots, if used, would need to keep a high level of flexibility and performance, meaning they would cost a lot to upkeep anyway. What I'm basically saying is that in theatre oftentimes money is not the sole motivator, as it might be with businesses or industries.

As the author writes, in performance *it's not the competition between human and machine that's important*. It's about how they can exist together to create a better performance. If robots and humans are near-indistinguishible, why not use both? And that's kind of the direction that we seem to be moving in.
