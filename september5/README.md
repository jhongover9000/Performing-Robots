### Autonomous Robots as Performing Agents

So, *woggles*. Sorry, that’s kinda my takeaway from the paper. Anyway, I thought that it was rather interesting to place *autonomous* robots in a performing stage–– the concept of puppetronics interests me because of the existence of artificial intelligence. I wish the paper went a bit deeper into how the intelligence part of the woggles worked, especially in their interactions with one another. For example, there’s a point where the woggle are described as having personalities, but the authors only write that some may bully others, while others may be shy. The interaction seems to only be in one direction, and I was curious as to how the Shrimp might react to the Wolf, as well as how those interactions might be programmed.

But of course, considering that this is a course about *robotics*, you can’t leave aside the physical aspects of puppetronics, in the context of the woggles. In a virtual context, interactions could be simpler to program, particularly “sight”, but when it comes to the real world, to physical implementation, I found it interesting that the authors separated “doing” and “seeing” actions. For example, a woggle would not only perform an action but also broadcast that it’s performing that action through its infrared sensors. I suppose that this is a limitation that occurs when you attempt to *simulate* sight without actually using computer vision (considering that the latter has seen advancements rather recently). I also wonder if something like this would be easier to do (puppetronics) with today’s technology and how that might be implemented.

The end of the paper mentions children being able to create detailed scripting of plots, which makes me a bit confused as to what they mean by this. Is it an abstract plot (robots are given goals, but are not given specifics on how to achieve those goals), or something more specific? Also, in this situation, are the audiences becoming the directors? Do the two roles mesh together when “interactivity” and “scriptability” appears?

Finally, there’s mention of the ALIVE System, which I suppose is actually quite similar to what VR or XR games could and do look like today. How real are robots/autonomous agents in such a situation–– what can make them realistic, and can that be considered a goal that technology is advancing towards? If moved into the context of puppetronics, what would be the goal of such agents? To create a new form of entertainment? Or maybe to create a sense of community or connection that can (currently) only be experienced amongst humans today?
